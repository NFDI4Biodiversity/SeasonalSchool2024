## About this workshop

The **NFDI4Biodiversity & iDiv Seasonal School on Data Management in Biodiversity and Environmental Science** is a collaboration between the [German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)](https://www.idiv.de) and the [NFDI4Biodiversity](https://nfdi4biodiversity.org) consortium. This course offers cutting-edge skills and knowledge essential for handling scientific data throughout its life cycle. The intensive five-day program combines direct knowledge transfer with practical lessons to introduce participants to fundamental and advanced tools in research data management (RDM), tailored to enhance their future careers.

### Scope

Participants will engage in a simulated scientific project that covers the entire data life cycle (DLC): data collection, integration from databases, quality control, visualization, and data publication. Using the GFBio DMP Tool, attendees will create a Data Management Plan (DMP) and map local plant occurrences with QField. They will also integrate datasets from repositories like PANGAEA, utilize Jupyter and R for data analysis and visualization, and learn how to publish data on platforms such as PANGAEA and GBIF.

### Learning objectives

You will learn...
*    How to create a data management plan
*    How to use Jupyter in combination with R (and Python) as working environment
*    Legal aspects of handling data
*    How to handle spatial data
*    How to integrate data from different sources
*    How to publish data
